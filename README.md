# Tonbun
Tonbun is a desktop app for reading and downloading manga. With clean distraction-free design and no clutter. Build with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org/) API. 

The app is still in early development and might be unstable. Feel free to contribute and make issues. If you have questions or suggestions, message me on Discord `KPidS#3754` or on Telegram [@KPidS](https://t.me/kpids). 

### Search and download mangas

Powered by [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org/) API
